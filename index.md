# About

## About me
I'm a software engineer and data scientist. I've lectured at SCU as an adjunct, and really enjoy teaching.

Topics I find especially interesting:
- natural language processing
- SVD-built & deep learned embeddings
- functional programming

## About this site
Personal sites are often extended resumes. For that info, you can check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbie-culkin/).

Instead, I plan to use this site as a personal catalog for my projects & CS-related thoughts.
